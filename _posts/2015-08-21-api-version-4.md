The first functions of the new [API](http://dev.spamty.eu/) version 4 are online. 

You can use it to [create a short url](http://dev.spamty.eu/shorturlcreate) and to [view a link](http://dev.spamty.eu/shorturlview) from a short url. More to come soon...

### Changelog
* You now have to authenticate with an additional username to your API key and the API requests are logged.
* Furthermore the API now uses **HTTPS only**.

It was a little bit quiet in our blog. I was working on the back-end of the Spamty website and our server.

We are now using git and we have an awesome internal bugtracker powered by Bumpy-Booby, which is available as open source software on [GitHub](https://github.com/Spamty/Bumpy-Booby).

The website translation in [Chinese](https://spamty.eu/cn/) is mainly created with Google Translator, so it is not perfect yet. 
But the website is now also available with [upside down text](https://spamty.eu/up/) and [Emojis](https://spamty.eu/ej/).

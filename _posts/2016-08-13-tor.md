The Spamty website is now accessible via Tor. Our domain is:
[spamtywj2qitskfu.onion](http://spamtywj2qitskfu.onion).

[Get the Tor browser](https://www.torproject.org/download/download-easy.html.en) and safely browse the Internet.

You can simply replace the `spamty.eu` domain in your links to our .onion domain to share your email address on the darknet.
If your normal Spamty link was:
```
https://spamty.eu/mail/v4/20/869656557u8375992c/
```
You can now use this link with Tor:
```
http://spamtywj2qitskfu.onion/mail/v4/20/869656557u8375992c/
```

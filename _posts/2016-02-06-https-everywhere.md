We moved the complete site to a new server and added Let's Encrypt SSL certificates everywhere.

You can now safely browse the [Spamty Website](https://spamty.eu/), our Blog and the API documentation.

The API was always only available with HTTPS but we now added a valid certificate so you won't get any error notifications.
